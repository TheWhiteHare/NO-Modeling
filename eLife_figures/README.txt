=======Instructions to recreate figures=======

1. download full folder to MATLAB directory
2. download and add chronux to MATLAB directory
	http://chronux.org/
3. open and run "generate_figures.m" script

==============================================

	scripts and functions used

==============================================

generate_structures.m
this script analyze all data in the the data folder into a single structure which is used by generate_figures.m to generate all the figures in the manuscipt
----------------------------------------------
generate_figures.m
uses the data structure generated by generate_structures.m to create figures
----------------------------------------------
support scripts (folder)
	contains functions to create each figure. generate_figures.m calls these functions to create each figure.

---------------------(INCOMPLETE)-------------------------
Data (folder)
	contains txt and csv files generated by COMSOL. the data folder is further sub-divided into folders for each figure. Data files (txt,csv) can be recreated with COMSOL 5.2 with MATLAB livelink installed. open COMSOL models contained in folder of the figure you want to recreate. Ensure that COMSOL is linked with MATLAB and can access the:
	dilation_matlab_kernel.m
	getGammaBandPower.m
these MATLAB functions will tell COMSOL: how much to deform the vessel based on the past concentrations in the smooth muscle (dilation_matlab_kernel) and how much nitric oxide (NO) to produce for figure 6 when evaluating the HRF in response to a white gaussian noise production rate.
